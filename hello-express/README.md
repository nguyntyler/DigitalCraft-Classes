1. npm init -y: Creates a package.json
2. npm install express: node_modules
    - Dev dependency vs regular dependency
      -dev: Tools needed to work on the app.
      -regular: libraries that make the app work at all.
        - ex: npm install nodemon --save-dev (This saves into the package.json under dev-dependencies.)

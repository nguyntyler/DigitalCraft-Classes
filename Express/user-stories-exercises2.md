# Who are your users?

The users are mostly customers looking to purchase a product.

# What does the user want?

They want to see:

-   The product photo. A description of the item. The price. What other users who have bought the item says about the item.
-   A purchasing option and ETA of delivery.
-   A list of related items and comaprisons. List of items often bought with that item.

All of these are clearly placed on the screen for user's ease of access.

# Why do they want to do them?

The photo, price, description, and other customer reviews all help the user make an informed purchase for the item. They need to know what they are buying and for how much.

The purchasing option allows them to quickly buy the item without the need for the seller to be a part of the transaction.

Lists of related items further the user experience by giving them options but also introducting them to new items they may not know they need.
